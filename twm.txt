STATELY, plump Buck Mulli-
gan came from the stairhead,
bearing a bowl of lather on which a
mirror and a razor lay crossed. A
yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was
sustained gently behind him by the
mild morning air. He held the bowl
aloft and intoned:

-Introibo ad altare Dei.
Halted, he peered down the dark
winding stairs and called up coarse-
ly:

-Come up, Kinch. Come up, you
fearful jesuit.

Solemnly he came forward and
mounted the round gunrest. He
faced about and blessed gravely
thrice the tower, the surrounding
country and the awaking mountains.
Then, catching sight of Stephen De-
dalus, he bent towards him and
made rapid crosses in the air, gur-
gling in his throat and shaking his
head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased
and sleepy, leaned his arms on the
top of the staircase and looked cold-
ly at the shaking gurgling face that
blessed him, equine in its length, and
at the light untonsured hair, grained
and hued like pale oak.

Buck Mulligan peeped an instant
under the mirror and then covered
the bowl smartly.

-Back to barracks, he said
sternly.

He added in a preacher's tone:
-For this, O dearly beloved, is
the genuine Christine: body and soul
and blood and ouns. Slow music,
please. Shut your eyes, gents. One
moment. A little trouble about those
white corpuscles.  Silence, all.

He peered sideways up and gave
a long low whistle of call, then
paused a while in rapt attention, his
even white teeth glistening here and
there with gold points. Chrysosto-
mos. Two strong shrill whistles an-
swered through the calm.

-Thanks, old chap, he cried
briskly. That will do nicely. Switch
off the current, will you?

He skipped off the gunrest and
looked gravely at his watcher, gath-
ering about his legs the loose folds of
his gown. The plump shadowed face
and sullen oval jowl recalled a pre-
late, patron of arts in the middle
ages. A pleasant smile broke quietly
over his lips.

-The mockery of it, he said gai-
ly. Your absurd name, an ancient
Greek.

He pointed his finger in friendly
jest and went over to the parapet,
laughing to himself.   Stephen De-
dalus stepped up, followed him
wearily halfway and sat down on the
edge of the gunrest, watching him
still as he propped his mirror on the
parapet, dipped the brush in the
bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.

Buck Mulligan's gay voice went
on.

-My name is absurd too: Mal-
achi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it
has a Hellenic ring, hasn't it? Trip-
ping and sunny like the buck himself.
We must go to Athens. Will you
come if I can get the aunt to fork
out twenty quid?

He laid the brush aside and, laugh-
ing with delight, cried:

-Will he come? The jejune
jesuit.

Ceasing, he began to shave with
care.

-Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen
said quietly.

-Yes, my love?

-How long is Haines going to
stay in this tower?

Buck Mulligan showed a shaven
cheek over his right shoulder.

-God, isn't he dreadful? he said
frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He
thinks you're not a gentleman. God,
these bloody English. Bursting with
money and indigestion. Because he
comes from Oxford. You know,
Dedalus, you have the real Oxford
manner. He can't make you out. O,
my name for you is the best: Kinch,
the knifeblade.

He shaved warily over his chin.

-He was raving all night about
a black panther, Stephen said.
Where is his guncase?

-A woful lunatic, Mulligan said.
Were you in a funk?

-I was, Stephen said with energy

and growing fear. Out here in the
dark with a man I don't know raving
and moaning to himself about shoot-
ing a black panther. You saved men
from drowning. I'm not a hero,
however. If he stays on here I am
off.

Buck Mulligan frowned at the
lather on his razor blade. He hop-
ped down from his perch and began
to search his trouser pockets hastily.

-Scutter, he cried thickly.

He came over the gunrest and,
thrusting a hand into Stephen's up-
per pocket, said:

-Lend us a loan of your noserag
to wipe my razor.

Stephen suffered him to pull out
and hold up on show by its corner a
dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck
Mulligan wiped the razorblade neat-
ly. Then, gazing over the handker-
chief, he said:

-The bard's noserag. A new art
color for our Irish poets: snotgreen.
You can almost taste it, can't you?

He mounted to the parapet again
and gazed out over Dublin bay, his
fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.

-God, he said quietly. Isn't the
sea what Algy calls it: a grey sweet
mother? The snotgreen sea. The
scrotumtightening sea. Epi oinopa
ponton. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks. I
must teach you. You must read
them in the original. Thalatta!
Thalatta! She is our grey sweet
mother.  Come and look.

Stephen stood up and went over
to the parapet. Leaning on it he
looked down on the water and on
the mailboat clearing the harbor
mouth of Kingstown.

-Our mighty mother, Buck Mul-
ligan said.

He turned abruptly his great
searching eyes from the sea to
Stephen's face.

-The aunt thinks you killed your
mother, he said. That's why she
won't let me have anything to do
with you.

-Someone killed her, Stephen
said gloomily.

-You could have knelt down,
damn it, Kinch, when your dying
mother asked you, Buck Mulligan
said. I'm hyperborean as much as
you. But to think of your mother
begging you with her last breath to
kneel down and pray for her. And
you refused. There is something
sinister in you...

He broke off and lathered again
lightly his farther cheek. A toler-
ant smile curled his lips.

-But a lovely mummer, he mur-
mured to himself. Kinch, the loveli-
est mummer of them all.

He shaved evenly and with care,
in silence, seriously.

Stephen, an elbow rested on the
jagged granite, leaned his palm
against his brow and gazed at the
fraying edge of his shiny black coat-
sleeve. Pain, that was not yet the
pain of love, fretted his heart. Si-
lently, in a dream she had come to
him after her death, her wasted body
within its loose brown graveclothes
giving off an odor of wax and rose-
wood, her breath, that had bent upon
him, mute, reproachful, a faint odor
of wetted ashes. Across the thread-
bare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed
as a great sweet mother by the well-
fed voice beside him. The ring of
bay and skyline held a dull green
mass of liquid. A bowl of white
china had stood beside her deathbed

holding the green sluggish bile which
she had torn up from her rotting
liver by fits of loud groaning vomit-
ing.

Buck Mulligan wiped again his
razorblade.

-Ah, poor dogsbody, he said in
a kind voice. I must give you a shirt
and a few noserags. How are the
secondhand breeks?

-They fit well enough, Stephen
answered.

Buck Mulligan attacked the hol-
low beneath his underlip.

-The mockery of it, he said con-
tentedly, secondleg they should be.
God knows what poxy bowsy left
them off. I have a lovely pair with
a hair stripe, grey. You'll look spif-
fing in them. I'm not joking, Kinch.
You look damn well when you're
dressed.

-Thanks, Stephen said. I can't
wear them if they are grey.

-He can't wear them, Buck Mul-
ligan told his face in the mirror.
Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his
mother but he can't wear grey
trousers.

He folded his razor neatly and
with stroking palps of fingers felt
the smooth skin.

Stephen turned his gaze from the
sea and to the plump face with its
smokeblue mobile eyes.

-That fellow I was with in the
Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,
says you have g. p. i. He's up in
Dottyville with Conolly Norman.
General paralysis of the insane.

He swept the mirror a half circle
in the air to flash the tidings abroad
in sunlight now radiant on the sea.
His curling shaven lips laughed and
the edges of his white glittering
teeth. Laughter seized all his strong
wellknit trunk.

-Look at yourself, he said, you
dreadful bard.

Stephen bent forward and peered
at the mirror held out to him, cleft
by a crooked crack, hair on end. As
he and others see me. Who chose
this face for me? This dogsbody to
rid of vermin.   It asks me too.

-I pinched it out of the skivvy's
room, Buck Mulligan said. It does
her all right. The aunt always keeps
plainlooking servants for Malachi.
Lead him not into temptation. And
her name is Ursula.

Laughing again, he brought the
mirror away from Stephen's peering
eyes.

-The rage of Caliban at not see-
ing his face in a mirror, he said. If
Wilde were only alive to see you.

Drawing back and pointing, Ste-
phen said with bitterness:

-It is a symbol of Irish art. The
cracked lookingglass of a servant.

Buck Mulligan suddenly linked
his arm in Stephen's and walked with
him round the tower, his razor and
mirror clacking in the pocket where
he had thrust them.

-It's not fair to tease you like
that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.
God knows you have more spirit
than any of them.

Parried again. He fears the lan-
cet of my art as I fear that of his.
The cold steel pen.

-Cracked lookinglass of a serv-
ant. Tell that to the oxy chap
downstairs and touch him for a
guinea. He's stinking with money
and thinks you're not a gentleman.
His old fellow made his tin by selling
jalap to Zulus or some bloody swin-
dle or other. God, Kinch, if you and
I could only work together we might
do something for the island. Hel-
lenise it.

Cranly's arm.  His arm.

-And to think of your having
to beg from these swine. I'm the
only one that knows what you are.
Why don't you trust me more?
What have you up your nose against
me? Is it Haines? If he makes
any noise here I'll bring down Sey-
mour and we'll give him a ragging
worse than they gave Clive Kemp-
thorpe.

Young shouts of moneyed voices
in Clive Kempthorpe's rooms. Pale-
faces: they hold their ribs with
laughter, one clasping another, O, I
shall expire! Break the news to her
gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With
slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the
air he hops and hobbles round the
table, with trousers down at heels,
chased by Ades of Magdalen with
the tailor's shears. A scared calf's
face gilded with marmalade. Don't
you play the giddy ox with me!

Shouts from the open window
startling evening in the quadrangle.
A deaf gardener, aproned, masked
with Matthew Arnold's face, pushes
his mower on the sombre lawn
watching narrowly the dancing motes
of grasshalms.

To ourselves... new pagan-
ism... omphalos.

-Let him stay, Stephen said.
There's nothing wrong with him ex-
cept at night.

-Then what is it? Buck Mulli-
gan asked impatiendy. Cough it up.
I'm quite frank with you. What have
you against me now?

They halted, looking towards the
blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on
the water like the snout of a sleeping
whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.

-Do you wish me to tell you? he
asked.

-Yes, what is it? Buck Mulli-
gan answered. I don't remember
anything. 

He looked in Stephen's face as he
spoke. A light wind passed his
brow, fanning softly his fair un-
combed hair and stirring silver points
of anxiety in his eyes.

Stephen, depressed by his own
voice, said:

-Do you remember the first day
I went to your house after my moth-
er's death?

Buck Mulligan frowned quickly
and said:

-What? Where? I can't re-
anything. I remember only ideas
and sensations. Why? What hap-
pened in the name of God?

-You were making tea, Stephen
said, and I went across the landing
to get more hot water. Your mother
and some visitor came out of the
drawing room. She asked you who
was in your room.

-Yes?   Buck   Mulligan said.
What did I say?  I forget.

-You said, Stephen answered,
O, it's only Dedalus whose mother
is beastly dead.

A flush which made him seem
younger and more engaging rose to
Buck Mulligan's cheek.

-Did I say that? he asked. Well?
What harm is that?

He shook his constraint from
him nervously.

-And what is death, he asked,
your mother's or yours or my own?

You saw only your mother die. I see
them pop off every day in the Mater
and Richmond and cut up into tripes
in the dissecting room. It's a beastly
thing and nothing else.   It simply
doesn't matter.  You wouldn't kneel
down to pray for your mother on her
deathbed when she asked you. Why?
Because you have the cursed jesuit
strain in you, only it's injected the
wrong way.  To me it's all a mock-
ery and beastly.  Her cerebral lobes
are not functioning.   She calls the
doctor Sir Peter Teazle and picks
buttercups off the quilt.  Humor her
till it's over.   You crossed her last
wish in death and yet you sulk with
me because I don't whinge like some
hired mute from Lalouette's. Ab-
surd! I suppose I did say it.  I didn't
mean to offend the memory of your
mother.

He had spoken himself into bold-
ness. Stephen, shielding the gaping
wounds which the words had left in
his heart, said very coldly:

-I am not thinking of the offence
to my mother.

--Of what, then?  Buck Mulli-
gan asked.

-Of the offence to me, Stephen
answered.

Buck Mulligan swung round on his
heel.

-O, an impossible person! he ex-
claimed.

He walked off quickly round the
parapet. Stephen stood at his post,
gazing over the calm sea toward the
headland. Sea and headland now
grew dim. Pulses were beating in
his eyes, veiling their sight, and he
felt the fever of his cheeks.

A voice within the tower called
loudly;

-Are you up there, Mulligan?
-I'm coming, Buck Mulligan an-
swered.

He turned toward Stephen and

said:

-Look at the sea. What does it
care about offences? Chuck Loyola,
Kinch, and come on down. The
Sassenach wants his morning rashers.

His head halted again for a mo-
ment at the top of the staircase, level
with the roof:

-Don't mope over it all day, he
said. I'm inconsequent. Give up
the moody brooding.

His head vanished but the drone
of his descending voice boomed out
of the stairhead:

And no more turn aside and brood

Upon love's bitter mystery

For Fergus rules the brazen cars.

Woodshadows floated silently by
through the morning peace from the
stairhead seaward where he gazed.
Inshore and farther out the mirror
of water whitened, spurned by light-
shod hurrying feet. White breast
of the dim sea. The twining stresses,
two by two. A hand plucking the
harpstring merging their twining
chords. Wavewhite wedded words
shimmering on the dim tide.

A cloud began to cover the sun
slowly, shadowing the bay in deeper
green. It lay behind him, a bowl of
bitter waters. Fergus' song: I sang
it alone in the house, holding down
the long, dark chords. Her door was
open: she wanted to hear my music.
Silent with awe and pity I went to
her bedside. She was crying in her
wretched bed. For those words,
Stephen: love's bitter mystery.

Where now?

Her secrets: old feather fans, tas-
seled dancecards, powdered with
musk, a gaud of amber beads in her
locked drawer. A birdcage hung in
the sunny window of her house when
she was a girl. She heard old Royce
sing in the pantomime of Turko the
terrible and laughed with others
when he sang:

I am the boy
That can enjoy
Invisibility.

Phantasmal mirth, folded away:

muskper fumed.

And no more turn aside and brood.

Folded away in the memory o
nature with her toys. Memories be-
set his brooding brain. Her glass of
water from the kitchen tap when she
had approached the sacrament. A
cored apple, filled with brown sugar,
roasting for her at the hob on a dark
autumn evening. Her shapely fin-
gernails reddened by the blood of
squashed lice from the children's
shirts.

In a dream, silently, she had come
to him, her wasted body within its
loose graveclothes giving off an odor
of wax and rosewood, her breath
bent over him with mute secret
words, a faint odor of wetted ashes.

Her glazing eyes, staring out of
death, to shake and bend my soul.
On me alone. The ghostcandle to
light her agony. Ghostly light on
the tortured face. Her hoarse loud
breath rattling in horror, while all
prayed on their knees. Her eyes on
me to strike me down.   Liliata ruti-
lantium te confessorum turma cir-
cumdet: jubilantium te virginum
chorus excipiat.

Ghoul!   Chewer of corpses!

No, mother. Let me be and let
me live.

Kinch ahoy!

Buck Mulligan's voice sang from
within the tower. It came nearer up
the staircase, calling again. Stephen,
still trembling at his soul's cry,
warm running sunlight and in the
air behind him friendly words.

-Dedalus, come down, like a
good mosey. Breakfast is ready.
Haines is apologising for waking us
last night.   It's all right.

-I'm coming, Stephen said, turn-
ing.

-Do, for Jesus' sake, Buck Mul-
ligan said. For my sake and for all
our sakes.

  His head disappeared and reap-
peared.

-I told him your symbol of Irish
art. He says it's very clever. Touch
him for a quid, will you? A guinea,
I mean.

-I get paid this morning, Stephen
said.

-The school kip? Buck Mulli-
gan said. How much? Four quid?
Lend us one.

If you want it, Stephen said.

-Four shining sovereigns, Buck
Mulligan cried with delight. We'll
have a glorious drunk to astonish the
druidy druids. Four omnipotent
sovereigns.

He flung up his hands and tramp-
ed down the stone stairs, singing out
of tune with a Cockney accent:

O, won't we have a merry time,
Drinking whiskey, beer and wine,

On coronation

Coronation day?

O, won't we have a merry time

On coronation day?

Warm sunshine merrying over the
sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,
forgotten on the parapet. Why
should I bring it down? Or leave it
there all day, forgotten friendship?

He went over to it, held it in his
hands a while, feeling its coolness,
smelling the clammy slaver of the
lather in which the brush was stuck.
So I carried the boat of incense then
at Clongowes. I am another now
and yet the same. A servant too. A
server of a servant.

In the gloomy domed livingroom
of the tower Buck Mulligan's gown-
ed form moved briskly about the
hearth to and fro, hiding and reveal-
ing its yellow glow. Two shafts of
soft daylight fell across the flagged
floor from the high barbacans: and
at the meeting of their rays a cloud
of coalsmoke and fumes of fried
grease floated, turning.

-We'll be choked, Buck Mulli-
gan said. Haines, open that door,
will you?

Stephen laid the shavingbowl on
the locker. A tall figure rose from
the hammock where it had been sit-
ting, went to the doorway and pulled
open the inner doors.

-Have you the key? a voice
asked.

-Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan
said.   Janey Mack, I'm choked.

He howled without looking up
from the fire:

-Kinch!

-It's in the lock, Stephen said,
coming forward.

The key scraped round harshly
twice and, when the heavy door had
been set ajar, welcome light and
bright air entered! Haines stood at
the doorway, looking out. Stephen
haled his upended valise to the table
and sat down to wait. Buck Mulli-
gan tossed the fry on to the dish be-
side him. Then he carried the dish
and a large teapot over to the table,
set them down heavily and sighed
with relief.

-I'm melting, he said, as the
candle remarked when... But hush.
Not a word more on that subject.
Kinch, wake up. Bread, butter,
honey. Haines, come in. The grub
is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and
these thy gifts. Where's the sugar?
O, jay, there's no milk.

Stephen fetched the loaf and the
pot of honey and the buttercooler
from the locker. Buck Mulligan sat
down in a sudden pet.

-What sort of a kip is this? he
said. I told her to come after eight.

-We can drink it black, Stephen
said. There's a lemon in the locker.

-O, damn you and your Paris
fads, Buck Mulligan said. I want
Sandycove milk.

Haines came in from the door-
way and said quietly:

-That woman is coming up with
the milk.

-The blessings of God on you,
Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up
from his chair. Sit down. Pour
out the tea there. The sugar is in
the bag. Here, I can't go fumbling
at the damned eggs. He hacked
through the fry on the dish and slap-
ped it out on three plates, saying:

-In nomine Patris et Filii et Spi-
ritus Sancti.

Haines sat down to pour out the
tea.

-I'm giving you two lumps each,
he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you
do make strong tea, don't you?

Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices
from the loaf said in an old woman's
wheedling voice:

-When I makes tea I makes tea,
as old mother Grogan said. And
when I makes water I makes wa-
ter.

-By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.

Buck Mulligan went on hewing
and wheedling:

-So I do, Mrs. Cahill, says she.
Begob, ma'am, says Mrs. Cahill,
God send you don't make them in
the one pot.

He lunged towards his messmates
in turn, a thick slice of bread im-
paled on his knife.

-That's folk, he said very earn-
estly, for your book, Haines. Five
lines of text and ten pages of notes
about the folk and the fishgods of
Dundrum. Printed by the weird
sisters in the year of the big wind.

He turned to Stephen and asked
in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
brows:

-Can you recall, brother, is
mother Grogan's tea and water pot
spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it
in the Upanishads?

-I doubt it, said Stephen grave-
ly.

-Do you now? Buck Mulligan
said in the same tone. Your reasons,
pray?

-I fancy, Stephen said as he ate,
it did not exist in or out of the Ma-
binogion. Mother Grogan was, one
imagines, a kinswoman of Mary
Ann.

Buck Mulligan's face smiled with
delight.

-Charming, he said in a finical
sweet voice, showing his white teeth
and blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do
you think she was? Quite charming.

Then, suddenly overclouding all
his features, he growled in a hoars-
ened rasping voice as he hewed again
vigorously at the loaf:

-For old Mary Ann

She doesn't care a damn.

But, fusing up her petticoats...

He crammed his mouth with fry
and munched and droned.

The doorway was darkened by an
entering form.

-The milk, sir.

-Come in, ma'am, Mulligan said,
Kinch, get the jug.

An old woman came forward and
stood by Stephen's elbow.

-That's a lovely morning, sir,
she said.  Glory be to God.

-To whom? Mulligan said,
glancing at her.  Ah, to be sure.

Stephen reached back and took the
milkjug from the locker.

-The islanders, Mulligan said to
Haines casually, speak frequendy of
the collector of prepuces.

-How much, sir? asked the old
woman.

-A quart, Stephen said.

He watched her pour into the
measure and thence into the jug rich
white milk, not hers. Old shrunken
paps. She poured again a measure-
ful and a tilly. Old and secret she
had entered from a morning world,
maybe a messenger. She praised the
goodness of the milk, pouring it out.
Crouching by a patient cow at day-

break in the lush field, a witch on her

toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick
at the squirting dugs. They lowed
about her whom they knew, dewsilky
cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old
woman, names given her in old
times. A wandering crone, lowly
form of an immortal serving her
conqueror and her gay betrayer,
their common cuckquean, a messen-
ger from the secret morning. To
serve or to upbraid, whether he
could not tell: but scorned to beg her
favor.

-It is indeed, ma'am, Buck Mul-
ligan said, pouring milk into their
cups.

-Taste it, sir, she said.

He drank at her bidding.

-If we could only live on good
food like that, he said to her some-
what loudly, we wouldn't have the
country full of rotten teeth and rot-
ten guts. Living in a logswamp,
eating cheap food and the streets
paved with dust, horsedung and con-
sumptives' spits.

-Are you a medical student, sir?
the old woman asked.

-I am, ma'am, Buck Mulligan
answered.

Stephen listened in scornful si-
lence. She bows her old head to a
voice that speaks to her loudly, her
bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
slights. To the voice that will shrive
and oil for the grave all there is of
her but her woman's unclean loins,
of man's flesh made not in God's
likeness, the serpent's prey. And
to the loud voice that now bids her
be silent with wondering unsteady
eyes.

-Do you understand what he
says? Stephen asked her.

-Is it French you are talking,
sir? the old woman said to Haines.

Haines spoke to her again a
longer speech, confidently.

-Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is
there Gaelic on you?

-I thought it was Irish, she said,
by the sound of it. Are you from
west, sir?

-I am an Englishman, Haines
answered.

-He's English, Buck Mulligan
said, and he thinks we ought to
speak Irish in Ireland.

-Sure we ought to, the old wom-
an said, and I'm ashamed I don't
speak the language myself. I'm told
it's a grand language by them that
knows.

-Grand is no name for it, said
Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entire-
ly. Fill us out some more tea, Kinch.
Would you like a cup, ma'am?

-No, thank you, sir, the old
woman said, slipping the ring of the
milkcan on her forearm and about to
go-

Haines said to her:

-Have you your bill? We had
better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we?

Stephen filled again the three cups.

-Bill, sir? she said, halting.
Well, it's seven mornings a pint at
two pence is seven twos is a shilling
and twopence over and these three
mornings a quart at fourpence is
three quarts is a shilling and one and
two is two and two, sir.

Buck Mulligan sighed and having
filled his mouth with a crust thickly
buttered on both sides, stretched
forth his legs and began to search
his trouser pockets.

-Pay up and look pleasant,
Haines said to him smiling.

Stephen filled a third cup, a spoon-
ful of tea coloring faintly the thick
rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought
up a florin, twisted it round in his
fingers and cried:

-A miracle!

He passed it along the table to-
ward the old woman, saying:

-Ask nothing more of me, sweet.
All I can give you I give.

Stephen laid the coin in her un-
eager hand.

-We'll owe twopence, he said.

-Time enough, sir, she said, tak-
ing the coin. Time enough. Good
morning, sir.

She curtseyed and went out, fol-
lowed by Buck Mulligan's tender
chant:

-Heart of my heart, were it more,
More would be laid at your feet.

He turned to Stephen and said:

-Seriously, Dedalus. I'm stony.
Hurry out to your school kip and
bring us back some money. Today
the bards must drink and junket. Ire-
land expects that every man this day
will do his duty.

-That reminds me, Haines said,
rising, that I have to visit your na-
tional library today.

-Our swim first, Buck Mulligan
said.

He turned to Stephen and asked
blandly:

-Is this the day for your monthly
wash, Kinch?

Then he said to Haines:

-The unclean bard makes a point
of washing once a month.

-All Ireland is washed by the
gulfstream, Stephen said as he let
honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.

Haines from the corner where he
was knotting easily a scarf about the
loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:

-I intend to make a collection of
your sayings if you will let me.

Speaking to me. They wash and
tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.
Conscience.  Yet here's a spot.

-That one about the cracked
lookingglass of a servant being
the symbol of Irish art is deuced
good.

Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen's
foot under the table and said with
warmth of tone:

-Wait till you hear him on Ham-
let, Haines.

-Well, I mean it, Haines said,
still speaking to Stephen. I was just
thinking of it when that poor old
creature came in.

-Would I make money by it?
Stephen asked.

Haines laughed and, as he took
his soft grey hat from the holdfast
of the hammock, said:

-I don't know, I'm sure.

He strolled out of the doorway.
Buck Mulligan bent across to Ste-
phen and said with coarse vigor:

-You put your hoof in it now.
What did you say that for?

-Well? Stephen said. The prob-
lem is to get money. From whom?
From the milkwoman or from him.
It's a toss up, I think.

-I blow him out about you, Buck
Mulligan said, and then you come
along with your lousy leer and your
gloomy jesuit jibes.

-I see little hope, Stephen said,
from her or from him.

Buck Mulligan sighed tragically
and laid his hand on Stephen's arm.

-From me, Kinch, he said.

In a suddenly changed tone he
added:

-To tell you the God's truth I
think you're right. Damn all else
they are good for. Why don't you
play them as I do? To hell with
them all. Let us get out of the kip.

He stood up, gravely ungirdled
and disrobed himself of his gown,
saying resignedly:

-Mulligan is stripped of his gar-
ments.

He emptied his pockets on to the
table.

-There's your snotrag, he said.

And putting on his stiff collar and
rebellious tie, he spoke to them, chid-
ing them, and to his dangling watch-
chain. His hands plunged and rum-
maged in his trunk while he called
for a clean handkerchief. Agenbite
of inwit. God, we'll simply have to
dress the character. I want puce
gloves and green boots. Contra-
diction. Do I contradict myself?
Very well, then, I contradict myself.
Mercurial Malachi. A limp black
missile flew out of his talking hands.

-And there's your Latin quarter
hat, he said.

Stephen picked it up and put it on.
Haines called to them from the door-
way:

-Are you coming, you fellows?

-I'm ready, Buck Mulligan an-
swered, going towards the door.
Come out, Kinch. You have eaten
all we left, I suppose. Resigned he
passed out with grave words and
gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:

-And going forth he met Butter-
ly.

Stephen, taking his ashplant from
its leaningplace, followed them out
and, as they went down the ladder,
pulled to the slow iron door and
locked it. He put the huge key in
his inner pocket.

At the foot of the ladder Buck
Mulligan asked:

-Did you bring the key?

-I have it, Stephen said, preced-
ing them. He walked on. Behind
him he heard Buck Mulligan club
with his heavy bathtowel the leader
shoots of ferns or grasses.

-Down, sir. How dare you, sir.

Haines asked.

-Do you pay rent for this
tower?

-Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan

said.

-To the secretary of state for
war, Stephen added over his shoul-
der.

They halted while Haines sur-
veyed the tower and said at last:

-Rather bleak in wintertime, I
should say.  Martello you call it?

-Billy Pitt had them built, Buck
Mulligan said, when the French were
on the sea. But ours is the ompha-
los.

-What is your idea of Hamlet?
Haines asked Stephen.

-No, no, Buck Mulligan shout-
ed in pain. I'm not equal to Thomas
Aquinas and the fifty-five reasons he
has made to prop it up. Wait till I
have a few pints in me first.

He turned to Stephen, saying as he
pulled down neatly the peaks of his
primrose waistcoat:

-You couldn't manage it under
three pints, Kinch, could you?

-It has waited so long, Stephen
said listlessly, it can wait longer.

-You pique my curiosity, Haines
said amiably.   Is it some paradox?

-Pooh I   Buck Mulligan said.

We have grown out of Wilde and
paradoxes. It's quite simple. He
proves by algebra that Hamlet's
grandson is Shakespeare's grandfa-
ther and that he himself is the ghost
of his own father.

-What? Haines said, beginning
to point at Stephen.  He himself?

Buck Mulligan slung his towel
stolewise round his neck and, bend-
ing in loose laughter, said to Ste-
phen's ear:

-O, shade of Kinch the elder!
Japhet in search of a father!

-We're always tired in the morn-
ing, Stephen said to Haines. And it
is rather long to tell.

Buck Mulligan, walking forward
again, raised his hands.

-The sacred pint alone can
unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he
said.

-I mean to say, Haines explained
to Stephen as they followed, this
tower and these cliffs here remind me
somehow of Elsinore. That beetles
o'er his base into the sea, isn't it?

Buck Mulligan turned suddenly
for an instant towards Stephen but
did not speak. In the bright silent
instant Stephen saw his own image
in cheap dusty mourning between
their gay attires.

-It's a wonderful tale, Haines
said, bringing them to halt again.

Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had
freshened, paler, firm and prudent.
The seas' ruler, he gazed south-
ward over the bay, empty save for
the smokeplume of the mailboat,
vague on the bright skyline, and a
sail tacking by the Muglins.

-I read a theological interpreta-
tion of it somewhere, he said be-
mused.   The Father and the Son
idea. The Son striving to be atoned
with the Father.

Buck Mulligan at once put on a
blithe broadly smiling face. He
looked at them, his wellshaped
mouth open happily, his eyes, from
which he had suddenly withdrawn
all shrewd sense, blinking with mad
gaiety. He moved a doll's head to
and fro, the brims of his Panama
hat quivering, and began to chant in
a quiet, happy, foolish voice:

-I'm the queerest young fellow
that ever you heard.

My mother's a Jew, my fath-
er's a bird.
With Joseph the joiner I can-
not agree,
So here's to disciples and Cal-
vary.

He held up a forefinger of warn-
ing.

-If anyone thinks that I amn't
divine

He'll get no free  drinks when

I'm making the wine
But have to drink water and

wish it were plain
That I make when the wine be-
comes water again.

He tugged swiftly at Stephen's
ashplant in farewell and, running
forward to a brow of the cliff, flut-
tered his hands at his sides like fins
or wings of one about to rise in the
air, and chanted:

-Goodbye, now, goodbye. Write

down all I said
And tell Tom, Dick and
Harry I rose from the dead.

What's bred in the bone can-
not fail me to fly
And Olivet's breezy...
Good-bye, now, goodbye.

He capered before them down
towards the fortyfoot hole, flutter-
ing his winglike hands, leaping
nimbly, Mercury's hat quivering in
the fresh wind that bore back to
them his brief, birdlike cries.

Haines, who had been laughing
guardedly, walked on beside Stephen
and said:

-We oughtn't to laugh, I sup-
pose. He's rather blasphemous.
I'm not a believer myself, that is to
say. Still, his gaiety takes the harm
out of it somehow, doesn't it? What
did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?

-The ballad of Joking Jesus,
Stephen answered.

-O, Haines said, you have
heard it before?

-Three times a day, after meals,
Stephen said drily.

-You're not a believer, are you?
Haines asked. I mean, a believer in
the narrow sense of the word. Cre-
ation from nothing and miracles and
a personal God.

-There's only one sense of the
word, it seems to me, Stephen said.

Haines stopped to take out a
smooth silver case in which twinkled
a green stone. He sprang it open
with his thumb and offered it.

-Thank you, Stephen said, tak-
ing a cigarette.

Haines helped himself and
snapped the case to. He put it
back in his sidepocket and took from
his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinder-
box, sprang it open too, and, having
lit his cigarette, held the flaming
spunk towards Stephen in the shell
of his hands.

-Yes, of course, he said, as they
went on again. Either you believe
or you don't, isn't it? Personally
I couldn't stomach that idea of a
personal God. You don't stand for
that, I suppose?

-You behold in me, Stephen said
with grim displeasure, a horrible ex-
ample of free thought.

He walked on, waiting to be
spoken to, trailing his ashplant by
his side. Its ferrule followed lightly
on the path, squealing at his heels.
My familiar, after me, calling
Steeeeeeeeeeeeeephen. A wavering
line along the path. They will walk
on it tonight, coming here in the
dark. He wants that key. It is
mine, I paid the rent. Now I eat
his salt bread. Give him the key,
too. All. He will ask for it. That
was in his eyes.

-After all, Haines began.. . .

Stephen turned and saw that the
cold gaze which had measured him
was not all unkind.

-After all, I should think you
are able to free yourself. You are
your own master, it seems to me.

-I am the servant of two
masters, Stephen said, an English
and an Italian.

-Italian?  Haines said.

A crazy queen, old and jealous.
Kneel down before me.

-And a third, Stephen said,
there is who wants me for odd jobs.

-Italian? Haines said again.
What do you mean?

-The imperial British state,
Stephen answered, his colour rising,
and the holy Roman catholic and
apostolic church.

Haines detached from his under-
lip some fibres of tobacco before he
spoke.

-I can't quite understand that,
he said calmly. An Irishman must
think like that, I daresay. We feel
in England that we have treated
you rather unfairly. It seems his-
tory is to blame.

The proud potent titles clanged
over Stephen's memory the triumph
of  their brazen  bells:  et unam
ecclesiam:  the  slow  growth and
change of rite and dogma like his
own rare thoughts, a chemistry of
stars.  Symbol of the apostles in the
mass for pope Marcellus, the voices
blended, singing alone loud in affir-
mation: and behind their chant the
vigilant angel of the church militant
disarmed and menaced her here-
siarchs.  A horde of heresies fleeing
with mitres awry: Photius and the
brood of mockers of whom Mulli-
gan was one, and Arius, warring his
life long upon the consubstantiality
of the Son with the Father, and Val-
entine,   spurning  Christ's terrene
body, and the subtle African here-
siarch Sabellius who held that the
Father was Himself His own Son.
Words Mulligan had spoken a mo-
ment   since   in   mockery to the
stranger.   Idle mockery.  The void
awaits surely all them that weave
the wind: a menace, a disarming and
a worsting from those embattled
angels of the church, Michael's host,
who defend her ever in the hour of
conflict with their lances and their
shields.

Hear, hear.  Prolonged applause.
Zut! Nom de Dieu!

-Of course  I'm  a Britisher,
Haine's voice said, and I feel as one.

I don't want to see my country fall
into the hands of German jews
either. That's our national prob-
lem, I'm afraid, just now.

Two men stood at the verge of
the cliff, watching: businessman,
boatman.

-She's making for Bullock har-
bour.

The boatman nodded towards the
north of the bay with some dis-
dain.

-There's five fathoms out there,
he said. It'll be swept up that way
when the tide comes in about one.
It's nine days today.

The man that was drowned. A
sail veering about the blank bay wait-
ing for a swollen bundle to bob up,
roll over to the sun a puffy face, salt
white.  Here I am.

They followed the winding path
down to the creek. Buck Mulligan
stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his
unclipped tie rippling over his
shoulder. A young man clinging to
a spur of rock near him, moved
slowly frogwise his green legs in the
deep jelly of the water.

-Is the brother with you, Mal-
achi?

-Down in Westmeath. With
the Bannons.

-Still there? I got a card from
Bannon. Says he found a sweet
young thing down there. Photo girl
he calls her.

-Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.

Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace
his boots. An elderly man shot up
near the spur of rock a blowing red
face. He scrambled up by the
stones, water glistening on his pate
and on its garland of grey hair,
water rilling over his chest and

paunch and spilling jets out of his
black sagging loincloth.

Buck Mulligan made way for him
to scramble past and, glancing at
Haines and Stephen, crossed himself
piously with his thumbnail at brow
and lips and breastbone.

-Seymour's back in town, the
young man said, grasping again his
spur of rock. Chucked medicine and
going in for the army.

-Ah, go to God, Buck Mulligan
said.

-Going over next week to stew.
You know that red Carlisle girl,
Lily?

-Yes.

-Spooning with him last night on
the pier. The father is rotto with
money.

-Seymour a bleeding officer,
Buck Mulligan said.

He broke off in alarm, feeling
his side under his flapping shirt.

-My twelfth rib is gone, he
cried. I'm the Uebermensch. Tooth-
less Kinch and I, the supermen.

He struggled out of his shirt and
flung it behind him to where his
clothes lay.

-Are you going in here, Mala-
chi?

-Yes.  Make room in the bed,

The young man shoved himself
backward through the water and
reached the middle of the creek in
two long, clean strokes. Haines sat
down on a stone, smoking.

-Are you not coming in, Buck
Mulligan asked.

-Later on, Haines said. Not on
my breakfast.

Stephen turned away.

-I'm going, Mulligan, he said.

-Give us that key, Kinch, Buck
Mulligan said, to keep my chemise
flat.

Stephen handed him the key. Buck
Mulligan laid it across his heaped
clothes.

-And twopence, he said, for a
pint.  Throw it there.

Stephen threw two pennies on the
soft heap. Dressing, undressing.
Buck Mulligan erect, with joined
hands before him, said solemnly:

-He who stealeth from the poor
lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake
Zarathustra.

His plump body plunged.

-We'll see you again, Haines
said, turning as Stephen walked up
the path and smiling at wild Irish.

Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse,
smile of a Saxon.

-The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.
Half twelve.

-Good, Stephen said.

He walked along the upwardcurv-
ing path.

Liliata rutilantium.
Turma circumdet.
Jubilantium te virginum

The priest's grey nimbus in a
niche where he dressed discreedy.
I will not sleep here tonight. Home
also I cannot go.

A voice, sweettoned and sustained,
called to him from the sea. Turning
the curve he waved his hand. It
called again. A sleek brown head,
a seal's, far out on the water, round.

Usurper.

YOU, Cochrane, what city sent
for him?
-Tarentum, sir.
-Very good. Well?
-There was a battle, sir.
-Very good. Where?
The boy's face asked the blank
window.

Fabled by the daughters of mem-
ory. And yet it was in some way if
not as memory fabled it. A phrase,
then, of impatience, thud of Blake's
wings of excess. I hear the ruin of
all space, shattered glass and
toppling masonry, and time one livid
final flame.  What's left us then?

-I forget the place, sir.   279 B.C.

-Asculum, Stephen said, glanc-
ing at the name and date in the gore-
scarred book.

-Yes, sir. And he said: Another
victory like that and we are done
for.

That phrase the world had re-
membered. A dull ease of the mind.
From a hill above a corpsestrewn
plain a general speaking to his offi-
cers, leaned upon his spear. Any
general to any officers. They lend
ear.

-You, Armstrong, Stephen said.
What was the end of Pyrrhus?

-End of Pyrrhus, sir?

-I know, sir. Ask me, sir.
Comyn said.

-Wait. You, Armstrong. Do
you know anything about Pyrrhus?

A bag of figrolls lay snugly in
Armstrong's satchel.  He curled
them between his palms at whiles
and swallowed them softly. Crumbs
adhered to the tissues of his lips.
A sweetened boy's breath. Welloff
people, proud that their eldest son
was in the navy. Vico Road, Dalkey.

-Pyrrhus, sir?  Pyrrhus, a pier.

All laughed. Mirthless, high ma-
licious laughter. Armstrong looked
round at his classmates, silly glee in
profile. In a moment they will laugh
more loudly, aware of my lack of
rule and of the fees their papas
pay.

-Tell me now, Stephen said,
poking the boy's shoulder with the
book, what is a pier.

-A pier sir, Armstrong said. A
thing out in the waves. A kind of
bridge.  Kingstown pier, sir.

Some laughed again: mirthless but
with meaning. Two in the back
bench whispered. Yes. They knew:
had never learned nor ever been in-
nocent. All. With envy he watched
their faces. Edith, Ethel, Gerty,
Lily. Their likes: their breaths, too,
sweetened with tea and jam, their
bracelets tittering in the struggle.

-Kingstown pier, Stephen said.
Yes, a disappointed bridge.

The words troubled their gaze.

-How, sir? Comyn asked. A
bridge is across a river.

For Haines's chapbook. No-one
here to hear. Tonight deftly amid
wild drink and talk, to pierce the
polished mail of his mind. What
then? A jester at the court of his
master, indulged and disesteemed,
winning a clement master's praise.
Why had they chosen all that part?
Not wholly for the smooth caress.
For them too history was a tale like
any other too often heard, their land
a pawnshop.

Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a bel-
dam's hand in Argos or Julius Cae-
sar not been knifed to death. They
are not to be thought away. Time
has branded them and fettered they
are lodged in the room of the infinite
possibilities they have ousted. But
can those have been possible seeing
that they never were?  Or was that
only possible which came to pass?
Weave, weaver of the wind.
-Tell us a story, sir.
-Oh, do, sir. A ghoststory.
-Where do you begin in this?
Stephen   asked,   opening another
book.

-Weep no more, Comyn said.,
-Go on then, Talbot.
-And the history, sir?
-After, Stephen said.   Go on,
Talbot.

A swarthy boy opened a book and
propped it nimbly under the breast-
work of his satchel. He recited
jerks of verse with odd glances at
the text:

-Weep no more, woful shep-
herd, weep no more
For Lycidas, your sorrow, is
not dead,
Sunk though he be beneath the
watery floor....

It must be a movement then, an
actuality of the possible as possible.
Aristotle's phrase formed itself
within the gabbled verses and floated
out into the studious silence of the
library of Saint Genevieve where he
had read, sheltered from the sin of
Paris, night by night. By his elbow
a delicate Siamese conned a hand-
book of strategy. Fed and feeding
brains about me: under glowlamps,
impaled, with faintly beating feelers:
and in my mind's darkness a sloth
of the underworld, reluctant, shy of
brightness, shifting her dragon scaly
folds. Thought is the thought of
thought. Tranquil brightness. The
soul is in a manner all that is: the
soul is the form of forms. Tran-
quillity sudden, vast, candescent:
form of forms.
Talbot repeated:

-Through the dear might of
Him that walked the waves.
Through the dear might....

-Turn over, Stephen said quiet-
ly.   I don't see anything.

-What, sir? Talbot asked
simply, bending forward.

His hand turned the page over.
He leaned back and went on again,
having just remembered. Of him
that walked the waves. Here also
over these craven hearts his shadow
lies and on the scoffer's heart and
lips and on mine. It lies upon their
eager faces who offered him a coin
of tribute. To Caesar what is
Caesar's, to God what is God's. A
long look from dark eyes, a riddling
sentence to be woven and woven on
the church's looms. Ay.

Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.
My father gave me seeds to sow.

Talbot slid his closed book into
his satchel.

-Have I heard all? Stephen
asked.

-Yes, sir.   Hockey at ten, sir.
-Half day, sir. Thursday.
-Who can answer a riddle?
Stephen asked.

They bundled their books away,

pencils clacking, pages rustling.
Crowding together they strapped
and buckled their satchels, all
gabbling gaily:

-A riddle, sir.  Ask me, sir.

-O, ask me, sir.

-A hard one, sir.

-This is the riddle, Stephen said:

The cock crew

The sky was blue;

The bells in heaven

Were striking eleven.

'Tis time for this poor soul

To go to heaven.

What is that?
-What, sir?

-Again, sir. We didn't hear.

Their eyes grew bigger as the
lines were repeated. After a silence
Cochrane said:

-What is it, sir? We give it
up.

Stephen, his throat itching, an-
swered:

-The fox burying his grand-
mother under a hollybush.

He stood up and gave a shout of
nervous laughter to which their cries
echoed dismay.

A stick struck the door and a voice
in the corridor called:

-Hockey!

They broke asunder, sidling out
of their benches, leaping them.
Quickly they were gone and from
the lumberroom came the rattle of.
sticks and clamour of their boots
and tongues.

Sargent, who alone had lingered,
came forward slowly, showing an
open copybook. His tangled hair
and scraggy neck gave witness of un-
readiness  and  through  his misty
glasses weak eyes looked up, plead-
ing. On his cheek, dull and blood-
less, a soft stain of ink lay, date-
shaped, recent and damp as a snail's
bed.

He held out his copybook. The
word Sums was written on the head-
line. Beneath were sloping figures
and at the loot a crooked signature
with blind loops and a blot. Cyril
Sargent: his name and seal.

-Mr. Deasy told me to write
them out all again, he said, and show
them to you, sir.

Stephen touched the edges of the
book. Futility.

-Do you understand how to do
them now? he asked.

-Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sar-
gent answered. Mr. Deasy said I
was to copy them off the board, sir.

-Can you do them yourself?
Stephen asked.

-No, sir.

"Ugly and futile: lean neck and
tangled hair and a stain of ink, a
snail's bed. Yet someone had loved
him, borne him in her arms and in
her heart. But for her the race of
the world would have trampled him
under foot, a squashed, boneless
snail. She had loved his weak, wa-
tery blood drained from her own.
Was that then, real? The only true
thing in life? His mother's pros-
trate body the fiery Columbanus in
holy zeal bestrode. She was no
more: the trembling skeleton of a
twig burnt in the fire, an odour of
rosewood and wetted ashes. She
had saved him from being trampled
under foot and had gone, scarcely
having been. A poor soul gone to
heaven: and on a heath beneath
winking stars a fox, red reek of ra-
pine in his fur, with merciless bright
eyes scraped in the earth, listened,
scraped up the earth, listened,
scraped and scraped.

Sitting at his side Stephen solved
out the problem. He proves by
algebra that Shakespeare's ghost is
Hamlet's grandfather. Sargent
peered askance through his slanted
glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the
lumberroom; the hollow knock of a
ball and calls from the field.

Across the page the symbols
moved in grave morrice, in the mum-
mery of their letters, wearing quaint
caps of squares and cubes. Give
hands, traverse, bow to partner: so:
imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone
too from the world, Averroes and
Moses Maimonides, dark men in
mien and movement, flashing in their
mocking mirrors the obscure soul of
the world, a darkness shining in
brightness which brightness could
not comprehend.

-Do you understand now? Can
you work the second for yourself?
-Yes, sir.

In long, shaky strokes Sargent
copied the data. Waiting always
for a word of help his hand moved
faithfully the unsteady symbols, a
faint hue of shame flickering behind
his dull skin. Amor matris: subjec-
tive and objective genitive. With
her weak blood and wheysour milk
she had fed him and hid from sight
of others his swaddling bands.

Like him was I, these sloping
shoulders, this gracelessness. My
childhood bends beside me. Too far
for me to lay a hand there once or
lightly. Mine is far and his secret
as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony,
sit in the dark palaces of both our
hearts: secrets weary of their tyran-
ny: tyrants willing to be dethroned.
The sum was done.
-It is very simple, Stephen said,
as he stood up.

-Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent an-
swered.

He dried the page with a sheet of
thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his desk.

-You had better get your stick
and go out to the others, Stephen
said as he followed towards the door
the boy's graceless form.
-Yes, sir.

In the corridor his name was
heard, called from the playfield.
-Sargent!

-Run on, Stephen said. Mr.
Deasy is calling you.

He stood in the porch and
watched the laggard hurry towards
the scrappy field where sharp voices
were in strife. They were sorted in
teams and Mr. Deasy came stepping
over wisps of grass with gaitered
feet. When he had reached the
schoolhouse voices again contending
called to him. He turned his angry
white moustache.

-What is it now? he cried con-
tinually without listening.

-Cochrane and Halliday are on
the same side, sir, Stephen cried.

-Will you wait in my study for
a moment, Mr. Deasy said, till I
restore order here.

And as he stepped fussily back
across the field his old man's voice
cried sternly:

-What is the matter? What is
it now?

Their sharp voices cried about
him on all sides: their many forms
closed round him, the garish sun-
shine bleaching the honey of his ill-
dyed head.

Stale smoky air hung in the study
with the smell of drab, abraded
leather of its chairs. As on the first
day he bargained with me here. As
it was in the beginning, is now. On
the sideboard the tray of Stuart
coins, base treasure of a bog: and
ever shall be. And snug in their
spooncase of purple plush, faded,
the twelve apostles having preached
to all the gentiles: world without
end.

A hasty step over the stone porch
and in the corridor. Blowing out his
rare moustache Mr. Deasy halted at
the table.

-First, our little financial settle-
ment, he said.

He brought out of his coat a
pocketbook bound by a leather
thong. It slapped open and he took
from it two notes, one of joined
halves, and laid them carefully on
the table.

-Two, he said, strapping and
stowing his pocketbook away.

And now his strongroom for the
gold. Stephen's embarrassed hand
moved over the shells heaped in the
cold stone mortar: whelks and
money cowries and leopard shells:
and this, whorled as an emir's tur-
ban, and this, the scallop of Saint
James. An old pilgrim's hoard,
dead treasure, hollow shells.

A sovereign fell, bright and new,
on the soft pile of the tablecloth.

-Three, Mr. Deasy said, turning
his little savingsbox about in his
hand. These are handy things to
have. See. This is for sovereigns.
This is for shillings, sixpences, half-
crowns.  And here crowns. See.
He shot from it two crowns and
two shillings.

-Three twelve, he said. I think
you'll find that's right.

-Thank you, sir, Stephen said,
gathering the money together with
shy haste and putting it all in a
pocket of his trousers.

-No thanks at all, Mr. Deasy
said. You have earned it.

Stephen's hand, free again, went
back to the hollow shells. Symbols
too, of beauty and of power. A
lump in my pocket. Symbols soiled
by greed and misery.

-Don't carry it like that, Mr.
Deasy said. You'll pull it out some-
where and lose it. You just buy one
of these machines. You'll find them
very handy.

Answer something.

-Mine would be often empty,
Stephen said.

The same room and hour, the
same wisdom: and I the same.
Three times now. Three nooses
round me here. Well, I can break
them in this instant if I will.

-Because you don't save, Mr.
Deasy said, pointing his finger. You
don't know yet what money is.
Money is power, when you have
lived as long as I have. I know, I
know. If youth but knew. But
what does Shakespeare say? Put
but money in thy purse.

-Iago, Stephen murmured.

He lifted his gaze from the idle
shells to the old man's stare.

-He knew what money was, Mr.
Deasy said. He made money. A
poet but an Englishman, too. Do
you know what is the pride of the
English? Do you know what is the

proudest word you will ever hear
from an Englishmen's mouth?

The seas' ruler. His seacold eyes
looked on the empty bay: history is
to blame: on me and my words, un-
hating.

-That on his empire, Stephen
said, the sun never sets.

-Ba! Mr. Deasy cried. That's
not English. A French Celt said
that.

He tapped his savingsbox against
his thumbnail.

-I will tell you, he said solemnly,
what is his proudest boast. I paid my
way.   Good man, good man.

-I paid my way.   I never bor-
rowed a shilling in my life.  Can you
feel that?   I  owe nothing. Can
you?

Mulligan, nine pounds, three pair
of socks, one pair brogues, ties.
Curran, ten guineas. McCann, one
guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.
Temple, two lunches. Russell, one
guinea. Cousins, ten shillings. Bob
Reynolds, half a guinea. Kohler,
three guineas. Mrs. McKernan, five
weeks' board. The lump I have is
useless.

-For the moment, no, Stephen
answered.

Mr. Deasy laughed with rich de-
light, putting back his savingsbox.

-I knew you couldn't, he said
joyously. But one day you must feel
it. We are a generous people but
we must also be just.

-I fear those big words, Stephen
said, which make us so unhappy.

Mr. Deasy stared sternly for
some moments over the mantelpiece
at the shapely bulk of a man in tar-
tan fillibegs: Albert Edward, Prince
of Wales.

-You think me an old fogey and
an old tory, his thoughtful voice
said. I saw three generations since.
O'Connell's time. I remember the
famine. Do you know that the
orange lodges agitated for repeal of
the union twenty years before
O'Connell did or before the prelates
of your communion denounced him
as a demagogue? You fenians for-
get some things.

Glorious, pious and immortal
memory. The lodge of Diamond in
Armagh the splendid behung with
corpses of papishes. Hoarse,
masked and armed, the planters cov-
enant. The black north and true
blue bible. Croppies lie down.
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.
-I have rebel blood in me too,
Mr. Deasy said. On the spindle side.
But I am descended from sir John
Blackwood, who voted for the
union. We are all Irish, all kings'
sons.

-Alas, Stephen said.

-Per vias rectos, Mr. Deasy said
firmly, was his motto. He voted for
it and put on his topboots to ride to
Dublin from the Ards of Down to
do so.

Lal the ral the ra
The rocky road to Dublin

A gruff squire on horseback with
shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John.
Soft day, your honour.... Day....
Day.... Two topboots jog dangling
on to Dublin. Lal the ral the ra, lal
the ral the raddy.

-That reminds me, Mr. Deasy
said. You can do me a favour, Mr.
Dedalus, with some of your literary
friends.   I have a letter here for

the press. Sit down a moment. I
have just to copy the end.

He went to the desk near the
window, pulled in his chair twice and
read off some words from the sheet
on the drum of his typewriter.

-Sit down. Excuse me, he said
over his shoulder, the dictates of
common sense.  Just a moment.

He peered from under his shaggy
brows at the manuscript by his el-
bow and, muttering, began to prod
the stiff buttons of the keyboard
slowly, some times blowing as he
screwed up the drum to erase an
error.

Stephen seated himself noiselessly
before the princely presence. Framed
around the walls images of vanished
horses stood in homage, their meek
heads poised in air: lord Hastings'
Repulse, the duke of Westminster's
Shotover, the duke of Beaufort's
Ceylon, prix de Paris, 1866. Elfin
riders sat them, watchful of a sign.
He saw their speeds, backing king's
colours, and shouted with the shouts
of vanished crowds.

-Full stop, Mr. Deasy bade his
keys. But prompt ventilation of this
important question....

Where Cranly led me to get rich
quick, hunting his winners among the
mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls
of bookies on their pitches and reek
of the canteen, over the motley slush.
Even money Fair Rebel: ten to one
the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers
we hurried by after the hoofs, the
vying caps and jackets and past the
meatfaced woman, a butcher's dame,
nuzzling thirstily her clove of
orange.

Shouts rang shrill from the boys'
playfield and a whining whistle.

Again: a goal. I am among them,
among their battling bodies in a
medley, the joust of life. You mean
that knockkneed mother's darling
who seems to be slightly crawsick?
Jousts. Time shocked rebounds,
shock by shock. Jousts, slush and
uproar of battles, the frozen death-
spew of the slain, a shout of spear
spikes baited with men's bloodied
guts.

-Now then, Mr. Deasy said, ris-
ing.

He came to the table, pinning to-
gether his sheets.  Stephen stood up.

-I have put the matter into a
nutshell, Mr. Deasy said. It's about
the foot and mouth disease. Just
look through it. There can be no
two opinions on the matter

May I trespass on your valuable
space. That doctrine of laissez faire
which so often in our history. Our
cattle trade. The way of all our old
industries.  Liverpool ring which
jockeyed the Galway harbour
scheme. European conflagration.
Grain supplies through the narrow
waters of the channel. The pluter-
perfect imperturbability of the de-
partment of agriculture. Pardoned
a classical allusion. Cassandra. By
a woman who was no better than she
should be. To come to the point at
issue.

-I don't mince words, do I? Mr.
Deasy asked as Stephen read on.

Foot and mouth disease. Known
as Koch's preparation. Serum and
virus. Percentage of salted horses.
Rinderpest. Emperor's horses at
Morzsteg, lower Austria. Veterin-
ary surgeons. Mr. Henry Black-
wood Price. Courteous offer a fair
trial.   Dictates of common sense.

Allimportant question. In every
sense of the word take the bull by
the horns. Thanking you for the
hospitality of your columns.

-I want that to be printed and
read, Mr. Deasy said. You will see
at the next outbreak they will put
an embargo on Irish cattle. And it
can be cured. It is cured. My
cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to
me it is regularly treated and cured
in Austria by cattledoctors there.
They offer to come over here. I am
trying to work up influence with the
department. Now I'm going to try
publicity. I am surrounded by diffi-
culties, by... intrigues by... back-
stairs influence by...

He raised his forefinger and beat
the air oldly before his voice spoke.

-Mark my words, Mr. Dedalus,
he said. England is in the hands of
the jews. In all the highest places:
her finance, her press. And they are
the signs of a nation's decay.
Wherever they gather they eat up
the nation's vital strength. I have
seen it coming these years. As sure
as we are standing here the jew mer-
chants are already at their work of
destruction.   Old England is dying.

He stepped swiftly off, his eyes
coming to blue life as they passed a
broad sunbeam. He faced about
and back again.

-Dying, he said, if not dead by
now.

The harlot's cry from street to
street.

Shall weave old England's wind-
ing sheet.

His eyes open wide in vision
stared sternly across the sunbeam in
which he halted.

-A merchant, Stephen said, is
one who buys cheap and sells dear,
jew or gentile, is he not?

-They sinned against the light,
Mr. Deasy said gravely. And you
can see the darkness in their eyes.
And that is why they are wanderers
on the earth to this day.

On the steps of the Paris Stock
Exchange the goldskinned men quot-
ing prices on their gemmed fingers.
Gabble of geese. They swarmed
loud, uncouth about the temple, their
heads thickplotting under maladroit
silk hats. Not theirs: these clothes,
this speech, these gestures. Their
full, slow eyes belied the words, the
gestures eager and unoffending, but
knew the rancours massed about
them and knew their zeal was vain.
Vain patience to heap and hoard.
Time surely would scatter all. A
hoard heaped by the roadside: plun-
dered and passing on. Their eyes
knew the years of wandering and,
patient, knew the dishonours of their
flesh.

-Who has not? Stephen said.

-What do you mean? Mr.
Deasy asked.

He came forward a pace and
stood by the table. His underjaw
fell sideways open uncertainly. Is
this old wisdom? He waits to hear
from me.

-History, Stephen said, is a
nightmare from which I am trying to
awake.

From the playfield the boys raised
a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.
What if that nightmare gave you a
back kick?

-The ways of the Creator are
not our ways, Mr. Deasy said. All

history moves towards one great
goal, the manifestation of God.

Stephen jerked his thumb towards
the window, saying:

-That is God.

Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!

-What? Mr. Deasy asked.

-A shout in the street, Stephen
answered, shrugging his shoulders.

Mr. Deasy looked down and held
for a while the wings of his nose
tweaked between his fingers. Look-
ing up again he set them free.

-I am happier than you are, he
said. We have committed many
errors and many sins. A woman
brought sin into the world. For a
woman who was no better than she
should be, Helen, the runaway wife
of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks
made war on Troy. A faithless
wife first brought the strangers to
our shore here, MacMurrough's
wife and her leman O'Rourke,
prince of Breffni. A woman too
brought Parnell low. Many errors,
many failures but not the one sin. I
am a straggler now at the end of my
days. But I will fight for the right
till the end.

For Ulster will fight
And Ulster will be right.

Stephen raised the sheets in his
hand.

-Well, sir, he began.

-I foresee, Mr. Deasy said, that
you will not remain here very long at
this work. You were not born to be
a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am
wrong.

-A learner rather, Stephen said.
And here what will you learn
more?

Mr. Deasy shook his head.

-Who knows? he said. To learn
 one must be humble.  But life is the
great teacher.

Stephen rustled the sheets again.

-As regards these, he began.

-Yes, Mr. Deasy said. You
have two copies there. If you can
have them published at once.

Telegraph. Irish Homestead.

-I will try, Stephen said, and let
you know tomorrow. I know two
editors slightly.

-That will do, Mr. Deasy said
briskly. I wrote last night to Mr.
Field, M. P. There is a meeting of
the cattletraders' association today
at the City Arms Hotel. I asked
him to lay my letter before the meet-
ing. You see if you can get it into
your two papers.   What are they?

-The Evening Telegraph....

-That will do, Mr. Deasy said.
There is no time to lose. Now I
have to answer that letter from my
cousin.

-Good morning, sir, Stephen
said, putting the sheets in his pocket.
Thank you.

-Not at all, Mr. Deasy said as
he searched the papers on his desk.
I like to break a lance with you, old
as I am.

-Good morning, sir, Stephen
said again, bowing to his bent back.

He went out by the open porch
and down the gravel path under the
trees, hearing the cries of voices
and crack of sticks from the play-
field. The lions couchant on the pil-
lars as he passed out through the
gate; toothless terrors. Still I will
help him in his fight. Mulligan will
dub me a new name: the bullockbe-
friending bard.
 -Mr. Dedalus!

Running after me. No more let-
ters, I hope.

-Just one moment.

-Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning
back at the gate.

Mr. Deasy halted, breathing hard
and swallowing his breath.

-I just wanted to say, he said.
Ireland, they say, has the honour of
being the only country which never
persecuted the jews. Do you know
that? No. And do you know why?

He frowned sternly on the bright
air.

-Why, sir, Stephen asked, begin-
ning to smile.

-Because she never let them in,
Mr. Deasy said solemnly.

A coughball of laughter leaped
from his throat dragging after it a
rattling chain of phlegm. He turned
back quickly, coughing, laughing,
his lifted arms waving to the air.

-She never let them in, he cried
again through his laughter as he
stamped on gaitered feet over the
gravel of the path.  That's why.

On his wise shoulders through the
checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
spangles, dancing coins.

INELUCTABLE modality of the
visible: at least that if no more,
thought through my eyes. Signa-
tures of all things I am here to read,

seaspawn and seawreck, the nearing
tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, blue-
silver, rust: coloured signs. Limits of
the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies.

Then he was aware of them bodies
before of them coloured. How? By
knocking his sconce against them,
sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a
millionaire, maestro di color che san-
no. Limit of the diaphane in. Why
in? Diaphane, a diaphane. If you
can put your five fingers through it,
it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your
eyes and see.

Stephen closed his eyes to hear his
boots crush crackling wrack and
shells. You are walking through it
howsomever. I am, a stride at a
time. A very short space of time
through very short times of space.
Five, six: the nacheinander. Exact-
ly: and that is the ineluctable modal-
ity of the audible. Open your eyes.
No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that
beetles o'er his base, fell through the
nebeneinander ineluctably. I am get-
ting on nicely in the dark. My ash
sword hangs at my side. Tap with
it: they do. My two feet in his boots
are at the end of his legs, nebenein-
ander. Sounds solid: made by the
mallet of Los Demiurgos. Am I
walking into eternity along Sandy-
mount strand? Crush, crack, crick,
crick. Wild sea money. Dominie
Deasy kens them a'.

Won't you come to Sandymount,
Madeline the mare?

Rhythm begins, you see. I hear.
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs
marching. No, agallop: 'define the
mare.

Open your eyes now. I will. One
moment. Has all vanished since?
If I open and am for ever in the
black adiaphane. Basta/ I will see
if I can see.

See now. There all the time with-
out you: and ever shall be, world
without end.

They came down the steps from
Leahy's terrace prudently, Frauen-
zimmer: and down the shelving
shore flabbily their splayed feet sink-
ing in the silted sand. Like me, like
Algy, coming down to our mighty
mother. Number one swung lourd-
ily her midwife's bag, the other's
gamp poked in the beach. From the
liberties, out for the day. Mrs.
Florence MacCabe, relict of the late
Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of
Bride Street. One of her sisterhood
lugged me squealing into life. Cre-
ation from nothing. What has she
in the bag? A misbirth with a trail-
ing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.
The cords of all link back, strand-
entwining cable of all flesh. That is
why mystic monks. Will you be as
gods? Gaze in your omphalos.
Hello. Kinch here. Put me on to
Edenville. Aleph, alpha: nought,
nought, one.

Spouse and helpmate of Adam
Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. She
had no navel. Gaze. Belly without
blemish, bulging big, a buckler of
taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn,
orient and immortal, standing from
everlasting to everlasting. Womb of
sin.

Wombed in sin darkness I was
too, made not begotten. By them,
the man with my voice and my eyes
and a ghostwoman with ashes on her
breath. They clasped and sundered,
did the coupler's will. From before
the ages He willed me and now may
not will me away or ever. A lex
eterna stays about Him. Is that then
the divine substance wherein Father
and Son are consubstantial? Where
is poor dear Arius to try conclu-
sions? Warring his life long on the
contransmagnificandjewbangtantiai-
ity. Illstarred heresiarch. In a
Greek watercloset he breathed his
last: euthanasia. With beaded mitre
and with crozier, stalled upon his
throne, widower of a widowed see.

Airs romped around him, nipping
and eager airs. They are coming,
waves. The whitemaned seahorses,
champing, brightwindbridled, the
steeds of Mananaan.

I mustn't forget his letter for the
press. And after? The Ship, half
twelve. By the way go easy with that
money like a good young imbecile.
Yes, I must.

His pace slackened. Here. Am I
going to Aunt Sara's or not? My
consubstantial father's voice. Did
you see anything of your artist
brother Stephen lately? No? Sure
he's not down in Strasburg terrace
with his aunt Sally? Couldn't he fly
a bit higher than that, eh? And and
and and tell us Stephen, how is un-
cle Si? O weeping God, the things
I married into. De boys up in de
hayloft. The drunken little cost-
drawer and his brother, the cornet
player. Highly respectable gondo-
liers. And skeweyed Walter sirring
his father, no less. Sir. Yes, sir.
No, sir. Jesus wept: and no won-
der, by Christ.

I pull the wheezy bell of their
shuttered cottage: and wait. They
take me for a dun, peer out from a
coign of vantage.

-It's Stephen, sir.

-Let him in. Let Stephen in.

A bolt drawn back and Walter
welcomes me.

-We thought you were someone
else.

In his broad bed nuncle Richie,
pillowed and blanketed, extends over
the hillock of his knees a sturdy fore-
arm. Cleanchested. He has washed
the upper moiety.

-Morrow, nephew.

He lays aside the lapboard where-
on he drafts his bills of cost for the
eyes of Master Goff and Master
Shapland Tandy, filing consents and
common searches and a writ of
Duces Tecum. A bogoak frame over
his bald head: Wilde's Requiescat.
The drone of his misleading whistle
brings Walter back.

-Yes, sir?

-Malt for Richie and Stephen,
tell mother. Where is she?

-Bathing Crissie, sir.

Papa's little bedpal. Lump of
love.

-No, uncle Richie....

-Call me Richie. Damn your li-
thia waters. It lowers. Whusky!

-Uncle Richie, really....

-Sit down or by the law Harry
I'll knock you down.

Walter squints vainly for a chair.

-He has nothing to sit down on,
sir.

-He has nowhere to put it, you
mug. Bring in our Chippendale
chair. Would you like a bite of
something? None of your damned
lawdeedaw air here; the rich of a
rasher fried with a herring? Sure?
So much the better. We have noth-
ing in the house but backache pills.

All'erta!

He drones bars of Ferrando's
aria di sortita. The grandest num-
ber, Stephen, in the whole opera.
Listen.

His tuneful whistle sounds again,
finely shaded, with rushes of the air,
his fists bigdrumming on his padded
knees.

This wind is sweeter.
Houses of decay, mine, his and
all. You told the Clongowes gentry
you had an uncle a judge and an
uncle a general in the army. Come
out of them, Stephen. Beauty is not
there. Nor in the stagnant bay of
Marsh's library where you read the
fading prophecies of Joachim Ab-
bas. For whom? The hundredhead-
ed rabble of the cathedral close. A
hater of his kind ran from them to
the wood of madness, his mane
foaming in the moon, his eyeballs
stars. Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled.
The  oval equine  faces, Temple,
Buck   Mulligan,   Foxy Campbell,
Lantern jaws.  Abbas father, furi-
ous dean what offence laid fire to
their brains? Paff! Descende, calve,
ut ne nimium decalveris. A garland
of gray hair on his comminated head
see him me clambering down to the
footpace   (descende),   clutching a
monstrance, basiliskeyed. Get down,
bald poll! A choir gives back men-
ace and echo, assisting about the al-
tar's horns, the snorted Latin of
jackpriests moving burly in their
albs, tonsured and oiled fat with the
fat of kidneys of wheat.

And at the same instant perhaps
a priest round the corner is elevat-
ing it. Dringdring! And two streets
off another locking it into a pyx.
Dringadring! And in a ladychapel
another taking housel all to his own
cheek. Dringdring! Down, up, for-
ward, back. Dan Occam thought of
that, invincible doctor. A misty Eng-
lish morning the imp hypostasis tic-
kled his brain. Bringing his host
down and kneeling he heard twine
with his second bell the first bell in
the transept (he is lifting his) and,
rising, heard (now I am lifting)
their two bells (he is kneeling)
twang in diphthong.

Cousin Stephen, you will never be
a saint. Isle of saints. You were
awfully holy, weren't you? You
prayed to the Blessed Virgin that
you might not have a red nose. You
prayed to the devil in Serpentine
avenue that the fubsy widow in front
might lift her clothes still more
from the wet street. O si, certo!
Sell your soul for that, do, dyed
rags pinned round a squaw. More
tell me, more still! On the top of
the Howth tram alone crying to the
rain: naked women! What about
that, eh?

What about what? What else
were they invented for?

Reading two pages apiece of seven
books every night, eh? I was young.
You bowed to yourself in the mirror,
stopping forward to applause earn-
estly, striking face. Hurray for the
Goddamned idiot! Hray! No one
saw: tell no one. Books you were
going to write with letters for ti-
tles.   Have you read his F? O
yes, but I prefer Q. Yes, but W
is wonderful. O yes, W. Remem-
ber your epiphanies on green oval
leaves, deeply deep, copies to be
sent if you died to all the great
libraries of the world, including
Alexandria? Someone was to read
them there after a few thousand
years, a mahamanvantara. Pico della
Mirandola   like.   Ay,   very like
a whale.   When one reads these
strange pages of one long gone one
feels that one is at one with one who
once....

The grainy sand had gone from
under his feet. His boots trod again
a damp crackling mast, razorshells,
squeaking pebbles, that on the un-
numbered pebbles beats, wood sieved
by the shipworm, lost Armada. Un-
wholesome sandflats waited to suck
his treading soles, breathing upward
sewage breath. He coasted them,
walking warily. A porterbottle stood
up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey
sand dough. A sentinel: isle of
the shore; at the land a maze of
dark cunning nets; farther away
chalkscrawled backdoors and on the
higher beach a dryingline with two
crucified shirts. Ringsend: wigwams
of brown steersmen and master mar-
iners. Human shells.

He halted. I have passed the way
to aunt Sara's. Am I not going
there? Seems not. No one about.
He turned northeast and crossed
the firmer sand towards the Pigeon-
house.

-Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue
position?

-C'est le pigeon, Joseph.

Patrice, home on furlough, lapped
warm milk with me in the bar Mac-
Mahon. Son of the wild goose,
Kevin Egan of Paris. My father's a
bird, he lapped the sweet lait chaud
with pink young tongue, plump
bunny's face. Lap, lapin. He hopes
to win the gros lots. About the na-
ture of women he read in Michelet.
But he must send me La Vie de
Jesus by M. Leo Taxil. Lent it to
his friend.

-C'est tordant, vous savez. Moi
je suis socialiste. Je ne crois pas en

l'existence de Dieu. Faut pas de dire,
a mon pere.
-II croit?
-Mon pere, oui.
Schluss. He laps.
My Latin quarter hat. God, we
simply must dress the character. I
want puce gloves. You were a stu-
dent, weren't you? Of what in the
other devil's name? Paysayenn. P.
C. N., you know: physiques, chim-
iques et naturelles.  Aha. Eating
your goatsworth of mou en civet,
fleshpots of Egypt, elbowed by belch-
ing cabmen. Just say in the most nat-
ural tone: when I was in Paris, boul'
Mich', I used to. Yes, used to carry
punched tickets to prove an alibi if
they arrested you for murder some-
where. Justice. On the night of the
seventeenth of February, 1904, the
prisoner was seen by two witnesses.
Other fellow did it: other me. Hat,
tie, overcoat, nose. Lui, c'est moi.
You seem to have enjoyed your-
self.

Proudly walking.   Whom were
you trying to walk like? Forget: a
dispossessed. With mother's money
order, eight shillings, the banging
door of the post office slammed in
your face by the usher. Hunger
toothache.   Encore deux minutes.
Look clock.   Must get. Fermi.
Hired dog! Shoot him to bloody
bits with a bang shotgun, bits man
spattered walls all brass buttons.
Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack

Shake hands.  See what I meant,
see? O, that's all right. Shake a
shake. O, that's all only all right.

You were going to do wonders,
what? Missionary to Europe after
fiery Columbanus. Fiacre and Sco-
tus on their creepystools in heaven
spilt from their pintpots, loudlatin-
laughing: Euge! Euge! Pretending
to speak broken English as you
dragged your valise, porter three-
pence, across the slimy pier at New-
haven. Comment? Rich booty you
brought back; Le Tutu, five tattered
numbers of Pantalon Blanc et Cu-
lotte Rouge, a blue French telegram,
curiosity to show:

-Mother dying come home fa-
ther.

The aunt thinks you killed your
mother. That's why she won't.

Then here's a health to Mulli-
gan's aunt
And I'll tell you the reason why.
She always kept things decent in
The Hannigan famileye.

His feet marched in sudden proud
rhythm over the sand furrows, along
by the boulders of the south wall.
He stared at them proudly, piled
stone mammoth skulls. Gold light
on sea, on sand, on boulders. The
sun is there, the slender trees, the
lemon houses.

Paris rawly waking, crude sun-
light on her lemon streets. Moist
pith of farls of bread, the froggreen
wormwood, her matin incense, court
the air. Belluomo rises from the
bed of his wife's lover's wife, the
kerchiefed housewife is astir, a sau-
cer of acetic acid in her hands. In
Rodot's Yvonne and Madeleine
newmake there tumbled beauties,
shattering with gold teeth chaussons
of pastry, their mouths yellowed
with the pus of flan breton. Faces
of Paris men go by, their well-
pleased pleasers, curled conquista-
dores.

Noon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls
gunpowder cigarettes through fin-
gers smeared with printer's ink, sip-
ping his green fairy as Patrice his
white. About us gobblers fork spiced
beans down their gullets. Un demi
setier! A jet of coffee steam from
the burnished caldron. She serves
me at his beck.  Il est Irlandais.
Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux
irlandais, nous, Irlande, vous savez?
Ah, oui! She thought you wanted
a cheese hollandais. Your postpran-
dial, do you know that word? Post-
prandial.   There was a fellow I
knew once in Barcelona, queer fel-
low, used to call it his postprandial.
Well: slainte! Around the slabbed
tables the tangle of wined breaths
and grumbling gorges. His breath
hangs over our saucestained plates,
the green fairy's fang thrusting be-
tween his lips. Of Ireland, the Dal-
cassians, of hopes, conspiracies, of
Arthur Griffith now.  To yoke me
as his yokefellow, our crimes our
common cause. You're your father's
son. I know the voice. His fustian
shirt, sanguineflowered, trembles its
Spanish tassels at his secrets. M.
Drumont, famous journalist, Dru-
mont, know what he called queen
Victoria? Old hag with the yellow
teeth. Vieille ogresse with the dents
jaunes. Maude Gonne, beautiful wo-
man, La Patrie, M. Millevoye, Fe-
lix Faure, know how he died? Li-
centious men.

The blue fuse burns deadly be-
tween hands and burns clear. Loose
tobacco shreds catch fire: a flame
and acrid smoke light our corner.
Raw facebones under his peep of
day boy's hat How the head centre
got away, authentic version. Got up
as a young bride, man, veil, orange-
blossoms, drove out the road to
Malahide. Did, faith. Of lost lead-
ers, the betrayed, wild escapes. Dis-
guises, clutched at, gone, not here.

Spurned lover. I was a strapping
young gossoon at that time, I tell
you, I'll show you my likeness one
day. I was, faith. Lover, for her
love he prowled with colonel Rich-
ard Burke, tanist of his sept, under
the   walls   of   Clerkenwell and,
crouching, saw a flame of vengeance
hurl them upward in the fog. Shat-
tered glass and toppling masonry.
In gay Paree he hides, Egan of
Paris, unsought by any save by me.
Making his day's stations, the dingy
printingcase, his three taverns, the
Montmartre lair he sleeps short
night in, rue de la Goutte-d'Or,
damascened with flyblown faces of
the gone. Loveless, landless, wife-
less. She is quite nicey comfy with-
out her outcast man, madame, in rue
Git-le-Coeur, canary and two buck
lodgers.   Peachy cheeks, a zebra
skirt, frisky as a young thing's.
Spurned and undespairing. Tell Pat
you saw me, won't you?   I wanted
to get poor Pat a job one time.
Mon fils, soldier of France. I taught
him to sing. The boys of Kilkenny
are stout roaring blades. Know
that old lady? I taught Patrice that
Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strong-
bow's castle on the Nore. Goes
like this. O, O. He takes me, Nap-
er Tandy, by the hand.

O, O the "boys of
Kilkenny...

Weak wasting hand on mine.
They have forgotten Kevin Egan,

not he them. Remembering thee, O
Sion.

He had come nearer the edge of
the sea and wet sand slapped his
boots. The new air greeted him,
harping in wild nerves, wind of wild
air of seeds of brightness. Here, I
am not walking out to the Kish light-
ship, am I? He stood suddenly, his
feet beginning to sink slowly in the
quaking soil.  Turn back.

Turning, he scanned the shore
south, his feet sinking again slowly in
new sockets. The cold domed room
of the tower waits.   Through the
barbacans the shafts of light are
moving ever, slowly ever as my feet
are sinking, creeping duskward over
the dial floor.  Blue dusk, nightfall,
deep blue night.   In the darkness of
the dome they wait, their pushedback
chairs, my obelisk valise, around a
board of abandoned platters. Who
to clear it? He has the key.  I will
not sleep there when this night
comes.   A shut door of a silent
tower entombing their blind bodies,
the panthersahib and his pointer.
Call: no answer.  He lifted his feet
up from the suck and turned back by
the mole of boulders.   Take all,
keep all.   My soul walks with me,
form of forms.   So in the moon's
midwatches I pace the path above the
rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsi-
nore's tempting flood.

The flood is following me. I can
watch it flow past from here. Get
back then by the Poolbeg road to the
strand here. He climbed over the
sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on
a stool of rock, resting his ashplant
in a grike.

A bloated carcass of a dog lay
lolled on bladderwrack. Before him
the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.
Un coche enable, Louis Veuillot
called Gautier's prose. These heavy
sands are language tide and wind
have silted here. And there, the
stoneheaps of dead builders, a war-
ren of weasel rats. Hide gold there.
Try it. You have some. Sands and
stones. Heavy of the past. Sir
Lout's toys. Mind you don't get one
bang on the ear. I'm the bloody well
gigant rolls all them bloody well
boulders, bones for my stepping-
stones. Feefawfum. I zmellz de
bloodz odz an Iridzman.

A point, live dog, grew into sight
running across the sweep of sand.
Lord, is he going to attack me? Re-
spect his liberty.   You will not be
master of others or their slave. I
have my stick.   Sit tight. From
farther away, walking shoreward
across from the crested tide, figures,
two.  The two maries.  They have
tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.
Peekaboo.  I see you. No, the dog.
He is running back to them. Who?

Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here
to beach, in quest of prey, their
blood-beaked prows riding low on a
molten pewter surf.   Dane vikings,
torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their
breasts when Malachi wore the col-
lar of gold.   A school of turlehide
whales stranded in hot noon, spout-
ing, hobbling in the shallows. Then
from the starving cagework city a
horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people,
with flayers' knives, running, scaling,
hacking in green blubbery whale-
meat.   Famine, plague and slaugh-
ters.   Their blood is in me, their
lusts my waves.   I moved among
them on the frozen Liffey, that I,
a changeling, among the spluttering

resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none
to me.

The dog's bark ran towards him,
stopped, ran back. Dog of my ene-
my.  I just simply stood pale, silent,
bayed about.   Terribilia meditans.
A primrose doublet, fortune's knave,
smiled on my fear.  For that are you
pining, the bark of their applause?
Pretenders: live their lives. The
Bruce's brother, Thomas Fitzgerald,
silken   knight,   Perkin Warbeck,
York's false scion, in breeches of silk
of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day,
and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of
nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned.
All kings' sons.   Paradise of pre-
tenders then and now.   He saved
men from drowning and you shake
at a cur's yelping.  But the courtiers
who mocked Guido in Or san Mi-
chele were in  their own house.
House of... We don't want any
of  your medieval abstrusiosiries.
Would you do what he did? A boat
would be near, a lifebuoy. Naturlich,
put there for you.   Would you or
would you not?  The man that was
drowned nine days ago off Maiden's
rock. They are waiting for him now.
The truth, spit it out.  I would want
to.  I would try.   I am not a strong
swimmer. Water cold soft. When
I put my face into it in the basin at
Clongowes.   Can't see!  who's be-
hind me?  Out quickly, quickly! Do
you see the tide flowing quickly in
on all sides, sheeting the lows of
sands   quickly,   shellcocoacolored?
If I had land under my feet.  I want
his life still to be his, mine to be
mine.   A drowning man.   His hu-
man eyes scream to me out of hor-
ror of his death.  I... With him
together down... I could not save
her.   Waters:   bitter death: lost.

A woman and a man. I see her
skirties.  Pinned up, I bet.

Their dog ambled about a bank of
dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on
all sides. Looking for something
lost in a past life. Suddenly he made
off like a bounding hare, ears flung
back, chasing the shadow of a low-
skimming gull. The man's shrieked
whistle struck his limp ears. He
turned, bounded back, came nearer
trotted on twinkling shanks. On a
field tenney a buck, trippant, proper,
unattired. At the lacefringe of the
tide he halted with stiff forehoofs,
seaward pointed ears. His snout
lifted barked at the wavenoise,
herds of seamorse. They serpented
towards his feet, curtling, unfurling
many crests, every ninth, breaking,
plashing, from far, from farther out,
waves and waves.

Cocklepickers. They waded a lit-
tle way in the water and, stooping,
soused their bags, and, lifting them
again, waded out. The dog yelped
running to them, reared up and
pawed them, dropping on all fours,
again reared up at them with mute
bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept
by them as they came towards the
drier sand, a rag of wolf's tongue
redpanting from his jaws. His
speckled body ambled ahead of them
and then loped off at a calf's gallop.
The carcass lay on his path. He
stopped, sniffed, stalked round it,
brother, nosing closer, went round it,
sniffling rapidly like a dog all over
the dead dog's bedraggled fell.
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the
ground, moves to one great goal.
Ah, poor dogsbody. Here lies poor
dogsbody's body.

-Tatters! Out of that, you
mongrel.

The cry brought him skulking
back to his master and a blunt boot-
less kick sent him unscathed across
a pit of sand, crouched in flight. He
slunk back in a curve. Doesn't see
me. His hindpaws scattered sand:
then his forepaws dabbled and
delved. Something he buried there,
his grandmother. He rooted in the
sand, dabbling, delving and stopped
to listen to the air, scraped up the
sand again with a fury of his claws,
soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got
in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.

After he woke me up last night
same dream or was it? Wait. Open
hallway. Street of harlots. Remem-
ber. Haroun al Raschid. I am al-
mosting it. That man led me, spoke.
I was not afraid. The melon he
had he held against my face. Smiled:
cream fruit smell. That was the
rule, said. In. Come. Red carpet
spread. You will see who.

Shouldering their bags they
trudged, the red Egyptians. His
blued feet out of turnedup trousers
slapped the clammy sand, a dull
brick muffler strangling his unshaven
neck. With woman steps she fol-
lowed: the ruffian and his strolling
mort. Spoils slung at her back.
Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her
bare feet. About her windraw face
her hair trailed. Behind her lord
his helpmate, bing awast, to Rome-
ville. When night hides her body's
flaws calling under her brown shawl
from an archway where dogs have
mired. Her fancyman is treating
two Royal Dublins in O'Loughlin's
of Blackpitts. Buss her, wap in
rogue's rum lingo, for, O, my dimbcr
wapping dell. A shefiend's white-
ness under her rancid rags. Fum-
bally's lane that night: the tanyard
smells.

White thy fambles, red thy gan
And thy quarrons dainty is.
Couch a hogshead with me then.
In the darkmans clip and kiss.

Morose delectation Aquinas tun-
belly calls this, frate porcospino. Un-
fallen Adam rode and not rutted.
Call away let him: thy quarrons
dainty is. Language no whit worse
than his. Monkwords, marybeads
jabber on their girdles: roguewords,
tough nuggets patter in their pockets.

Passing now.

A side-eye at my Hamlet hat. If
I were suddenly naked here as I sit?
I am not. Across the sands of all the
world, followed by the sun's flaming
sword, to the west, trekking to eve-
ning lands. She trudges, schlepps,
trains, drags, trascines her load. A
tide westering, moondrawn, in her
wake. Tides, myriadislanded, with-
in her, blood not mine, oinopa pon-
ton, a winedark sea. Behold the
handmaid of the moon. In sleep
the wet sign calls her hour, bids her
rise. Bridebed, childbed, bed of
death, ghostcandled. Omnis caro ad
te veniet. He comes, pale vampire
through storm his eyes, his bat sails
bloodying the sea, mouth to her
mouth's kiss.

Here. Put a pin in that chap, will
you? My tablets. Mouth to her
kiss. No. Must be two of em.
Glue em well. Mouth to her
mouth's kiss.

His lips lipped and mouthed
fleshless lips of air.    His mouth

moulded issuing breath, unspeeched:
ooeeelah: roar of cataractic planets,
globed, blazing, roaring, wayaway-
awayawayawayaway. Paper. The
banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy's
letter. Here. Thanking you for
hospitality tear the blank end off.
Turning his back to the sun he bent
over far to a table of rock and scrib-
bled words. That's twice I forgot
to take slips from the library coun-
ter.

His shadow lay over the rocks as
he bent, ending.   Why not endless
till the farthest star?   Darkly they
are there behind this light, darkness
shining in the brightness, delta of
Cassiopeia, worlds.   Me sits there
with his augur's rod of ash, in bor-
rowed sandals, by day beside a livid
sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking
beneath a reign of uncouth stars, I
throw this ended shadow from me,
manshape ineluctable, call it back.
Endless, would it be mine, form of
my form?   Signs on a white field.
Somewhere to someone in your fluti-
est voice.    The good bishop of
Cloyne took the veil of the temple
out of his shovel hat: veil of space
with coloured emblems hatched on
its fields.  Hold hard.  Coloured on
a flat: yes, that's right.   Flat I see,
then think distance, near, far, flat I
see, east, back.  Ah, see now: Falls
back suddenly,  frozen in stereo-
scope.   Click does the trick. You
find my words dark.   Darkness is in
our souls, do you not think? Flutier.
Our souls, shamewounded by our
sins, cling to us yet more, a woman
to her lover clinging, the more the
more.

She trusts me, her hand gentle,
the longlashed eyes. Now where the
blue hell am I bringing her beyond
the veil? Into the ineluctable mo-
dality of the ineluctable visuality.
She, she, she. What she? The vir-
gin at Hodges Figgis' window on
Monday looking in for one of the
alphabet books you were going to
write. Keen glance you gave her.
Wrist through the braided jesse of
her sunshade. She lives in Leeson
park, with a grief and kickshaws, a
lady of letters. Talk that to some
one else, Stevie: a pickmeup. Bet
she wears those curse of God stays
suspenders and yellow stockings,
darned with lumpy wool. Talk
about apple dumplings, piuttosto.
Where are your wits?

Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft
soft hand. I am lonely here. O,
touch me soon, now. What is that
word known to all men? I am quiet
here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch
me.

He lay back at full stretch over
the sharp rocks, cramming the
scribbled note and pencil into a
pocket, his hat tilted down on his
eyes. That is Kevin Egan's move-
ment I made nodding for his nap,
sabbath sleep. Et vidit Deus. Et
erant valde bona. Alo! Bonjour,
welcome as the flowers in May.
Under its leaf he watched through
peacocktwittering lashes the south-
ing sun. I am caught in this burn-
ing scene. Pan's hour, the faunal
noon. Among gumheavy serpent-
plants, milkoozing fruits, where on
the tawny waters leaves lie wide.
Pain is far.
And no more turn aside and brood.

His gaze brooded on his broad
toed boots, a buck's castoffs neben-
einander. He counted the creases of

rucked leather wherein another's
foot had nested warm. The foot
that beat the ground in tripudium,
foot I dislove. But you were de-
lighted when Esther Osvalt's shoe
went on you: girl I knew in Paris.
Tiens, quel petit pied! Staunch
friend, a brother soul: Wilde's love
that dare not speak its name. He
now will leave me. And the blame?
As I am. As I am. All or not at
all.

In long lassoes from the Cock lake
the water flowed full, covering
green-goldenly lagoons of sand, ris-
ing, flowing. My ashplant will float
away. I shall wait. No, they will
pass on, passing chafing against the
low rocks, swirling, passing. Better
get this job over quick. Listen: a
fourworded wavespeech: seesoo,
hrss, rsseeiss ooos. Vehement
breath of waters amid seasnakes,
rearing horses, rocks. In cups of
rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap:
bounded in barrels. And, spent, its
speech ceases. It flows purling,
widely flowing, floating foam-pool,
flower unfurling.

Under the upswelling tide he saw
the writhing weeds lift languidly and
sway reluctant arms, hising up their
petticoats, in whispering water sway-
ing and upturning coy silver fronds.
Day by day: night by night: lifted,
flooded and let fall. Lord, they an
weary: and, whispered to, they sigh.
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of
leaves and waves, waiting, await-
ing the fullness of their times, diebus
ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemis-
cit. To no end gathered: vainly
then released, forth flowing, wending
back: loom of the moon. Weary
too in sight of lovers, lascivious
men, a naked woman shining in her
courts, she draws a toil of waters.

Five fathoms out there. Full fath-
om five thy father lies. At one he
said. Found drowned. High water
at Dublin bar. Driving before it a
loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of
fishes, silly shells. A corpse rising
saltwhite from the undertow, bob-
bing landward, a pace a pace a por-
poise. There he is. Hook it quick.
Sunk though he be beneath the
watery floor. We have. him. Easy
now.

Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul
brine. God becomes man becomes
fish becomes barnacle goose becomes
featherbed mountain. Dead breaths
I living breathe, tread dead dust,
devour a urinous offal from all dead.
Hauled stark over the gunwale he
breathes upward the stench of his
green grave, his leprous nosehole
snoring to the sun.

A seachange this, brown eyes salt-
blue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths
known to man. Old Father Ocean.
Prix de Paris: beware of imitations.
Just you give it a fair trial. We en-
joyed ourselves immensely.

Come. I thirst. Clouding over.
No black clouds anywhere, are
there? Thunderstorm. Allbright he
falls, proud lightning of the intellect,
Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum.
No. My cockle hat and staff and
hismy sandal shoon.   Where? To

evening lands. Evening will find it-
self.

He took the hilt of his ashplant,
lunging with it softly, dallying still.
Yes, evening will find itself in me,
without me. All days make their end.
By the way next when is it? Tuesday
will be the longest day.   Of all the
glad new year, mother, the rum
tum tiddledy tum. Lawn Tennyson,
gentleman poet.   Gia. For the old
hag with the yellow teeth. And
Monsieur Drumont, gentleman jour-
nalist. Gia. My teeth are very bad.
Why, I wonder?   Feel.   That one
is going too.  Shells.  Ought I go to
a dentist, I wonder, with that mon-
ey?   That one.   Toothless Kinch,
the superman. Why is that, I won-
der, or does it mean something per-
haps?

My handkerchief. He threw it. I
remember.   Did I not take it up?

His hand groped vainly in his
pockets. No, I didn't. Better buy
one.

He laid the dry snot picked from
his nostril on a ledge of rock, care-
fully. For the rest let look who will.

Behind. Perhaps there is some-
one.

He turned his face over a shoul-
der,  rere regardant. Moving
through the air high spars of a three-
master, her sails brailed up on the
crosstrees, homing, upstream, silent-
ly moving, a silent ship.
